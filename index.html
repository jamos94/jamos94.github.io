        <h1> Hello, I'm Jessica Amos</h1>
        <h2>JUNIOR PROGRAMMER</h2>
        <p> - an ambitious computer science major who is eager to begin her career as a developer. </p>
            <h3>How did you learn to code?</h3>
            <p>I have been learning code at a university level and through online courses such as Udemy.
                The majority of my projects through Southern New Hampshire University have been in C++ and Java.
                To increase the resources in my programming toolbox, been taking Python course based on coding challenges.</p>
                
                <h3>What would be your favorite and least favorite project thus far?</h3>
                <p>My favorite program projects include data structures and algorithms. My least favorite project I was assigned
                I worked with OpenGL to create visual graphics. Given more time to develop in OpenGL I may grow to appreciate it more.</p> 

                <h3>What programming related skills would you like to sharpen?</h3>
                <p>I would like to increase my knowledge of databases and algorithms. Although I have worked with data structures & algorithms
                    in a scenerio sense, I believe toning up these programming muscles will increase my net-worth as a programmer. </p>

                    <h3>What programs have you built?</h3>
                    <p> In Java...            </p>
                    <p>In HTML/CSS...</p>
                    <p>In C++...</p>
                    <p>In Python</p>
