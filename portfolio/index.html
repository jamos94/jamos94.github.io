        <p>I can’t say no to a good challenge. I’m a firm believer that if life is easy, you’re not learning much. I heard a quote recently that states “Progress is never linear.” There is not straight line to success. We often get knocked down or take a side road. It’s easy to overlook our own strengths. Yet, when we get back up, we are stronger and wiser than when we were. I can relate this to my personal life but also my professional. I encounter problems every day. Some seem more complex than my understanding. However, I have come to realize that most seemingly complex problems and simple solutions.</p>
