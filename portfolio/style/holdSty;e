  <!-- <p> - an ambitious computer science major who is eager to begin her career as a developer. </p>
  <h3>How did you learn to code?</h3>
  <p>I have been learning code at a university level and through online courses such as Udemy.
      The majority of my projects through Southern New Hampshire University have been in C++ and Java.
      To increase the resources in my programming toolbox, been taking Python course based on coding challenges.</p>
      
      <h3>What would be your favorite and least favorite project thus far?</h3>
      <p>My favorite program projects include data structures and algorithms. My least favorite project I was assigned
      I worked with OpenGL to create visual graphics. Given more time to develop in OpenGL I may grow to appreciate it more.</p> 

      <h3>What programming related skills would you like to sharpen?</h3>
      <p>I would like to increase my knowledge of databases and algorithms. Although I have worked with data structures & algorithms
          in a scenerio sense, I believe toning up these programming muscles will increase my net-worth as a programmer. </p>
